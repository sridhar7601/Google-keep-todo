## npm start

## npm audit

Description

The audit command submits a description of the dependencies configured in your project to your default registry and asks for a report of known vulnerabilities. 


## npm doctor

Description

npm doctor runs a set of checks to ensure that your npm installation has what it needs to manage your JavaScript packages. npm is mostly a standalone tool, but it does have some basic requirements that must be met:

Node.js and git must be executable by npm.
The primary npm registry, registry.npmjs.com, or another service that uses the registry API, is available.
The directories that npm uses, node_modules (both locally and globally), exist and can be written by the current user.
The npm cache exists, and the package tarballs within it aren't corrupt.
